# Web application for TCP/IP model

This web application is used to educate students about TCP/IP model. It is created with Python as backend.

I’m using Python Flask library, which is micro web framework, to handle all of the backend processes. To separate Python logic from HTML I’ve applied Jinja2 – fast, expressive, extensible web templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. For styling in css I’ve implemented Bootstrap frontend framework, but I’ve modified a lot of styles and added my own layout and appearance.

This app includes home page, authentication page, some informations about layers and protocols, and quiz page where you can work on your skills and add your own questions.
